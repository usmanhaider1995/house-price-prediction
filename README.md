# house-price-prediction
In this task on House Price Prediction using machine learning, our task is to use data from the California census to create a machine learning model to predict house prices in the State. The data includes features such as population, median income, and median house prices for each block group in California.

Block groups are the smallest geographic unit which typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people. We can call them districts for short. Ultimately, our machine learning model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median house price in any neighbourhood, given all other metrics.
